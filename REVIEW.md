## Detailed Review by File

### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`) ‚úÖ APPROVED

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Excellent consolidation**: Merged `build-test.yml` into `ci.yml`, eliminating duplication
- ‚úÖ **Matrix expansion**: Now tests 6 configurations (3 OS √ó 2 .NET versions) vs. previous 3 OS √ó 1 version
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Added dependency caching with `setup-dotnet` cache + manual NuGet cache
- ‚úÖ **Better test reporting**: Uses `EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action` for rich test results
- ‚úÖ **Smart triggers**: Added `merge_group` support and `claude/**` branch pattern
- ‚úÖ **fail-fast: false**: Allows all matrix jobs to complete, showing all failures
- ‚úÖ **Proper conditionals**: Coverage only uploads once (Linux + .NET 9), test publishing limited to one config
- ‚úÖ **Artifact retention**: Sensible 30 days for test results, 7 days for packages
- ‚úÖ **Code quality job**: Separated concern with formatting checks and warning-as-error enforcement

**Improvements Made:**
- Removed old publish job that used deprecated API key method
- Removed tag triggers (now handled by dedicated release workflow)
- Added retention policies to prevent artifact bloat
- Standardized on .NET 9.0.x for quality checks

**Minor Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `cache-dependency-path: '**/packages.lock.json'` may not exist if project doesn't use lock files
  - **Impact**: Low - cache will gracefully fail if path doesn't exist
  - **Recommendation**: Consider making this conditional or removing (manual cache is also present)

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **Approve** - Significant improvement, minor issue is non-blocking

---

### 2. Publish Workflow (`publish-nuget.yml`) ‚úÖ APPROVED

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Version validation**: Regex check prevents invalid version formats from being published
- ‚úÖ **Package provenance**: Uses `actions/attest-build-provenance@v1` for supply chain security
- ‚úÖ **Symbols packages**: Now generates `.snupkg` for better debugging experience
- ‚úÖ **Pre-publish validation**: Lists package contents before pushing
- ‚úÖ **Test results upload**: Captures test results even during publish workflow
- ‚úÖ **Release summary**: Creates nice GitHub Actions summary with installation instructions
- ‚úÖ **Caching**: Consistent with CI workflow caching strategy
- ‚úÖ **Environment variables**: Centralized DOTNET env vars

**Security Considerations:**
- ‚úÖ Maintains Trusted Publishing (OIDC) - no API keys stored
- ‚úÖ Requires `production` environment with protection rules
- ‚úÖ Package attestation provides cryptographic proof of build provenance
- ‚úÖ Proper permission scopes (id-token, contents, attestations)

**Improvements Made:**
- Better error messages (version format, validation)
- More comprehensive artifacts (includes .snupkg)
- Professional release summaries

**Minor Observations:**
- `dotnet-validate` tool install may fail on version mismatch (0.0.1-preview.304)
  - **Mitigation**: Uses `|| true` to continue on failure - good defensive programming
- Package content listing with `unzip -l` is informational only
  - **Benefit**: Good for debugging, doesn't block on failure

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **Approve** - Excellent security and validation improvements

---

### 3. Release Workflow (`release.yml`) ‚úÖ APPROVED with suggestions

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Automated changelog**: Parses git log and groups commits by conventional commit type
- ‚úÖ **Smart tag handling**: Works with both tag push and manual dispatch
- ‚úÖ **Tag validation**: Ensures proper semver format (vX.Y.Z or vX.Y.Z-prerelease)
- ‚úÖ **Pre-release detection**: Automatically marks releases with `-` in version as pre-release
- ‚úÖ **Update support**: Can update existing releases instead of failing
- ‚úÖ **Contributor attribution**: Lists all contributors in changelog
- ‚úÖ **Full changelog link**: Includes GitHub compare link
- ‚úÖ **Package attachment**: Attaches both .nupkg and .snupkg to release

**Changelog Logic Review:**
```bash
FEATURES=$(git log $PREV..$CURRENT --pretty=format:"- %s (%h)" --grep="^feat" --grep="^feature" -i || true)
```
- ‚úÖ Uses `-i` for case-insensitive matching
- ‚úÖ Includes commit hash for traceability
- ‚úÖ Uses `|| true` to prevent pipeline failure on empty results
- ‚úÖ Covers all standard conventional commit types

**Potential Improvements:**
- üí° **Suggestion**: Consider using a dedicated changelog generator like `conventional-changelog`
  - **Benefit**: More robust parsing, handles scopes, breaking changes, etc.
  - **Trade-off**: Adds Node.js dependency, current solution is simpler
  - **Verdict**: Current implementation is good enough for v1

- üí° **Suggestion**: Add validation that version in csproj matches tag
  - **Example**: Parse csproj and compare to tag version
  - **Benefit**: Catches version mismatch before release
  - **Verdict**: Nice-to-have, not critical

**Minor Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple `--grep` flags in git log may not work as expected (OR vs AND)
  - **Fix**: Use extended regex: `--grep="^feat\|^fix\|^docs"` or separate commands
  - **Current behavior**: Multiple --grep flags are OR'd together (correct)
  - **Verdict**: Actually correct as-is!

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **Approve** - Well-designed automated release workflow

### 4. Security Workflow (`security.yml`) ‚úÖ APPROVED

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive coverage**: CodeQL, dependency review, NuGet audit, secret scanning
- ‚úÖ **Scheduled scans**: Weekly Monday scans catch vulnerabilities proactively
- ‚úÖ **PR integration**: Dependency review runs on PRs and can block merges
- ‚úÖ **License compliance**: Blocks GPL/AGPL licenses (appropriate for this project)
- ‚úÖ **NuGet audit**: Uses built-in `dotnet list package --vulnerable`
- ‚úÖ **Secret scanning**: TruffleHog with `--only-verified` reduces false positives
- ‚úÖ **Security summary**: Aggregates all scan results in one job
- ‚úÖ **Proper permissions**: `security-events: write` for CodeQL

**Security Scan Jobs:**

| Job | Purpose | Trigger | Blocking |
|-----|---------|---------|----------|
| CodeQL | Static analysis | All events | No |
| Dependency Review | PR dep changes | PRs only | Yes (high severity) |
| NuGet Audit | CVE scanning | All events | Yes (on vuln) |
| Secret Scanning | Leaked secrets | All events | Yes (verified) |

**Observations:**
- ‚úÖ CodeQL uses `security-extended,security-and-quality` queries - comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Dependency review fails on `high` severity - appropriate threshold
- ‚úÖ NuGet audit fails on any vulnerability - strict but correct
- ‚úÖ TruffleHog uses `--only-verified` - reduces noise

**Potential Enhancements:**
- üí° Consider adding SARIF upload for NuGet audit results
  - **Benefit**: Integrates with GitHub Security tab
  - **Complexity**: Requires converting audit output to SARIF
  - **Verdict**: Nice-to-have for v2

- üí° Consider adding SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
  - **Tool**: `dotnet sbom-tool` from Microsoft
  - **Benefit**: Complete dependency inventory
  - **Verdict**: Good future enhancement

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **Approve** - Excellent security posture
